 -JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().

The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":

Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes:

Example
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';

-JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";

-JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements
Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";

-JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
